    "## Analyzing Impact of V2I connectivity in terms of traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project the main objective is to understand the impact of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication in traffic systems. In particular the focus will be oriented towards the creation of different kind of messages and understanding the effects of those messages in the traffic network.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/img/01_v2i.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that we are going to make use of the package `connectv2x` that includes some basic models and communication for `V2I` systems. For more information about the source code of this package please go [here](https://github.com/research-licit/itstools/tree/main/itstools). Over there you will find a folder called `connectv2x` containing all the models in the submodules `carfollow`, `vehicles`, `demand`, `messages` etc. Some of these will be explored along the module and may help you to progress faster in the project.   \n",

    "## Prelimenary note: \n",
    "## Getting started with the traffic simulation tool\n",
    "During this lab we offer you to work on a really simplified traffic simulation tool fully implemented on Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **traffic scenario** considered is the following: vehicles are driving along a corridor composed of 1 lane with a speed limit set to 90km/h. On a specific location of the corridor, road works occur and the speed is then restricted to 70 km/h for X km. Every vehicles are aware of the speed limit 1km priori to the effective road works. A RoadSideUnit (RSU) broadcasts messages to connected vehicles. Connected vehicles receive specific instructions and can adopt a smoother speed by anticipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented simulation tool comes with some assumptions and simplifications, among others:\n",
    "- **about vehicle behavior**: only the **longitudinal movements** of vehicles (according to a car-following model) on 1 traffic lane and 1 continuous section are reproduced: it involves no lane changing\n",
    "- **about initialization**: the vehicles are directly allocated all along the section under consideration\n",
    "- **about vehicle profile**: each vehicle is labelled by its status : connected or not. This label is used to set the kind of message received by the vehicle. \n",
    "- **road works modelling**: it is modeled by enforcing vehicles to follow speed instructions. It is assumed that the vehicle follow accurately the instructions. The instructions are modeled by a speed profile (sigmoïd) to follow\n",
    "- **about V2I modelling**: the telecommunication operating system, which ensures the V2I connectivity, is not explicitly modeled. Messages are supposed to be instantaneously broadcasted to the connected vehicles. The content of a message is composed of: (i) a distance of application (randomly generated by the modeler) and (ii) a speed profile (sigmoïd) to follow until the end of the road section. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps aim to get you started with these modelling assumptions. Then follow the project side, where it is expected that you further explore the potential of the V2I connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab is composed of 2 main parts:\n",
    "1. the first part (**GUIDED EXERCISE**) is dedicated to:\n",
    "   1. building the simulation environment by defining the Traffic Rules (Fundamental Diagram) and the car-following model, \n",
    "   2. building the scenario by featuring the roadworks's location\n",
    "   3. building your first message shared to Connected Vehicles\n",
    "   4. building your first Key Performance Indicators to measure impact on traffic efficiency and envrinonment (pollutant emissions)\n",
    "2. the second part (**OPENING**) is aiming at opening to new perspectives and, especially, it is expected that you design and implement an experimentation thanks to the tools developed/provided during the first part of the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first lab, some codes are provided as resources. Sometimes, the question is just asking that you execute the codes, sometimes it is reqired to slightly adapt the code to the new cse under consideration. The idea of the first part is that you re-use the resources provided to replay the questions and to better understand the modelling process. "
