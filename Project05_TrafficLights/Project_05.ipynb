    "In order to do that we are going to make use of the package `macrotrasim` that includes some network traffic modeling to model macroscopic traffic networks. This models include the deployment of hybrid switching traffic lights via the switched cell transmission model s-CTM , and a relaxed version considered as the average cell transmition model Avg-CTM. For more information about the source code of this package please go [here](https://github.com/research-licit/itstools/tree/main/itstools) .Over there you will find a folder called `macrotrasim` containing all the models in the submodules `lights`, `manhattan`, `traffic` etc. Some of these will be explored along the module and may help you to progress faster in the project.
