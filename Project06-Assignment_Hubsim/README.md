# Welcome to the Practical Exercise performed with HUBSIM

## Project purposes
This project is dedicated to analysing the impact of the disposal of Travel Time information on the road assignment. While some expert drivers will know about the usual congestions, a dummy driver will trend to follow the short path in distance. This practical exercise attempts to explore the impact of the information degree on the route choices operated by the drivers. It is assumed that Connected Driver will dispose of refined information, while non-connected drivers are restricted to their own knowledge of the network. The refinement degree of the information provided by the road operator is also under study.

## Project content
The lab is composed of 2 main steps:
* a partially GUIDED part dedicated to explore and get acquainted with the simulation tool,
* an OPENING part aiming to let you explore some new scenarios involving Variable Speed Limit strategies.

This Practical Lab only makes use of the [HUBSIM simulation platform](https://hubsim.neovya.fr/network) with a web interface. 

The instructions are available on this [HTML page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/licit-lab/ITSProjects/main/Project06-Assignment_Hubsim/HUBSIM_Sensitivity2TT_V2.html).
